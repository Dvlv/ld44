y:
Timmy returned downstairs to play with the rest of his presents. 

Nobody paid any attention to his slightly increased age. Everyone just assumed he had matured early, and he lived a normal life.

t:
Timmmy took a look at himself and saw a tall, spotty teenager. 

In a brief flash of creativity, he ran around altering his "11 Today" posters to say "17 Today" instead. 

He somehow convinced everybody that they were going crazy, and he had been a teenager for ages.

Unfortunately, his school grades were terrible, and Timmy became permanently grounded.



a:
In all of the excitement to be the best at Sweet Squish, Timmy had squandered away his entire childhood and teenage years. 

Now a fully grown adult, he felt it easier to run away than try to explain to his parents that he had been playing with the Time Accelerator. 

He now lives as a farmer, growing his own food.

He only eats vegetables, and won't touch another piece of candy again.
